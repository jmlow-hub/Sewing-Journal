I love dressmaking and this is a project I created as an app to journal my makes. This is a full stack app with a front-end built in React, an API built with Java in Sring Boot connected to a database in MySQL which I set up using MySQL Workbench. The API calls were tested using Postman. The front-end is hosted on Firebase and the back-end with GCP.

The app takes advantage of the built in CRUD functionality with Spring Boot and has a option to add a new project, update and delete as well as getting a record of your makes from the database.  The back-end is set-up with a controller and repository pattern.  Using Spring Boot really helped to streamline and simplify the process.

I really enjoyed putting this project together as it's something that interests me and would help me keep track of my projects. The next steps for me, as an extension, are to add search criteria and to investigate how to add pictures to the database.
